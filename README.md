### What is Tuongtaccheo?
[**Tuongtaccheo**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Tuongtaccheo) is a tool to get followers on your facebook account for free, before that you have to do a like or follow mission. This tool uses a system of exchanging followers among users.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this tool and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```

$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Tuongtaccheo
$ cd "Tuongtaccheo"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Tuongtaccheo" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### How to keep Facebook safe?
- Your Facebook account must use a telephone number, email and 2-factor authentication.
- Change the password after every use of the tools.
- You are required to use a fake account or a new account to log in to the tool.
- You must be willing if your Facebook account is used to exchange likes and follows.

### Why login failed?
- Maybe your Facebook account has been deactivated or hit by a checkpoint.
- Because you entered the wrong Tuongtaccheo account cookies or Facebook account cookies.
- Maybe the Tuongtaccheo service is undergoing an update or cloudflare.

### Mission fails?
- Because the account you follow is not available so you don't get coins.
- Maybe your Facebook account was blocked for 24 hours or more.
- Error from the Tuongtaccheo service so it doesn't show your coins.
- There are no missions that you can complete without getting coins.

### Configuration requirements?
- Facebook accounts must have a profile photo and 5 posts that are visible to the public.
- Facebook account must be 19 years or older, you can change the date of birth.
- Facebook accounts must have 20 or 50 more friends.
- Facebook accounts must join at least 1 group and must be active within 7 days.
- When you use a new account, complete the requirements and wait 2 weeks before it can be added to the configuration.

### Failed to exchange?
- Since your Facebook account doesn't have a follow button, make sure it only has a follow button.
- Maybe you entered the wrong post link or Facebook account userid.
- Maybe your Facebook account is locked or is in private mode.
- Because your Facebook post doesn't have a like button or is not a public post.

### Is your Facebook blocked?
- Your Facebook account must be online in the browser where you get cookies and refresh once every 1 minute.
- Use a delay of more than 60 seconds to be safer.
- Take a break for a few hours to avoid spam on your account.

### When will the purchase be received?
Followers and Likes will arrive in your account within 24 hours, this may take more than 24 hours if the tuongtaccheo service does not have many users. This is all influenced by whether or not many users use the service.
